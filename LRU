A Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache organizes items in order of use, allowing to quickly identify which item hasn't been used for the longest amount of time.
Becuse we redirect URL it make sense to remove least recently url and not popular one.

Advantages –
  Good performance: it takes into account the usage history of URL, and it can lead to faster application response times.
  Efficient use of memory: LRU leads to efficient use of memory because it replaces the URL that has not been used for the longest time. 
  Fairness: LRU is considered a fair algorithm because it takes into account the usage history of URL and replaces the least recently used URL first.
 
Disadvantages –
  It requires additional Data Structure to be implemented.
